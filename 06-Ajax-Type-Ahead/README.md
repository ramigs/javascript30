# Notes

- Fetch API is a more powerful and flexible alternative to `XMLHTTPRequest` for
  fetching resources (including across the network)
- `fetch()` returns a `Promise`, so its meant to be used with `then()` and
  `catch()`
- `keyup` DOM event to trigger a function every time an input changes
- using `this` to access the value property of the input object that calls
  `displayMatches`

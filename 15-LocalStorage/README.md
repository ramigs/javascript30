# Notes

- `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the page from refreshing when the `form` is submitted
- `this.querySelector('[name=item]')` to select the element inside the `form`
- ES6 shorthand property when there's a variable with the same name
- `this.reset()` to reset a form
- associating `input` with `label` with attribute `for`
- Local Storage is a list of Key - Value pairs that will persist even if the page refreshes
- Event delegation: the parent element listens for the event and delegate it to the child element
- `e.target.matches('input')` to check if `click` targeted an `input`

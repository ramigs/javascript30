# Notes

- clock's hands done with `div` elements
- `background-size: contain;` CSS to make png fully visible and take the size of the `div`
- `transform: rotate(Xdeg);` CSS
- `transform-origin: 100%` CSS to change the pivot point along the x-axis
- `transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier();` CSS to get cool unusual transition timings
- JavaScript function `setInterval` to run something every x milliseconds

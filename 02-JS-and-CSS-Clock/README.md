# Notes

- clock's hands done with ```div``` elements
- ```background-size: contain;``` to make png fully visible and take the size of the ```div```
- ```transform: rotate(Xdeg);```
- ```transform-origin: 100%``` to change the pivot point along the x-axis
- ```transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier();``` to get cool unusual transition timings
- JavaScript function ```setInterval``` to run something every x milliseconds

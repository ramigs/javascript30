# Notes

- `const endTime = new Date(timestamp);` to convert a timestamp to `Date`
- `clearInterval` to stop the the interval set by `setInterval`
- HTML attribute `name` allows JavaScript to call it right away , as in
`document.customForm`
- `e.preventDefault()` to prevent form data from appearing on the URL
- `this.reset()` to clear form

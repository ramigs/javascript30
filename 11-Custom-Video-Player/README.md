# Notes

- A lot of interesting properties for the HTML element `video`
- Progress bar filled with `flex-basis`
- Video event 'timeUpdate' to keep updating progress bar
- `click` event property `e.offsetX` to get where the user clicked
- Cool trick to run a function if variable is true:
```javascript
mousedown && scrub(e)
```
- Toggling play with space bar also
- Fullscreen added but behaves differently in Chrome and Firefox. Chrome automatically sets up UI for fullscreen video. Firefox doesn't set up anything.
